# 📝 Day 5 — To-Do List App

This project is part of my **30-Day Python Challenge**.

A simple command-line To-Do List application that allows users to add, view, and remove tasks interactively.

---

## 🧠 How the Program Works
- Displays a menu with options:
  - Add a task
  - View tasks
  - Remove a task
  - Exit the app
- Tasks are stored in a list during runtime
- Users can remove tasks by selecting their number
- Input validation prevents invalid choices

---

## 🛠 Concepts Practiced
- Lists and list operations
- Loops
- Conditional statements
- User input handling
- Input validation with `try/except`
- Menu-driven program design
