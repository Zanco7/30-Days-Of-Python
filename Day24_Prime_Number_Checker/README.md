# Day 24 — Prime Number Checker

This project is a command-line Prime Number Checker built with Python as part of my **30-Day Python Challenge**.

## Features
- Checks whether a given number is prime
- Handles invalid input safely
- Allows repeated checks without restarting the program
- Efficient prime checking using square root optimization

## How It Works
1. The user enters a number.
2. Numbers less than or equal to 1 are marked as non-prime.
3. The program checks divisibility from 2 up to the square root of the number.
4. Displays whether the number is prime or not.
5. The user can choose to check another number or exit.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- While loops
- For loops
- Conditional statements
- Error handling (try/except)
- Math optimization

## How to Run
```bash
python prime_number_checker.py
