# 🎲 Day 8 — Dice Roller (Python)

This project is part of my **30-Day Python Challenge**.

The Dice Roller is a simple Python program that simulates rolling a six-sided dice.  
Each time the user chooses to roll, the program generates a random number between **1 and 6**, just like a real dice.

## 🚀 Features
- Generates a random dice number (1–6)
- Simple and interactive user input
- Runs continuously until the user decides to exit
- Beginner-friendly Python logic

---

## ▶️ How It Works
1. The program asks the user if they want to roll the dice.
2. If the user enters **y**, a random number between 1 and 6 is generated.
3. If the user enters **n**, the program exits.
4. The program keeps running until the user chooses to stop.

## 🧠 What I Learned
- Using the `random` module
- Working with `while` loops
- Handling user input correctly
- Building simple interactive programs
