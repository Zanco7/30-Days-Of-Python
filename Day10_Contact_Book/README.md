# Day 10 – Contact Book 📒

This project is part of my **30-Day Python Challenge**.

Today, I built a **Contact Book** application that allows users to manage contacts using a simple menu-based system.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Add new contacts
- View all saved contacts
- Search for a contact by name
- Update an existing contact
- Delete a contact
- Exit the program safely

---

## 🧠 What I Learned
- Using dictionaries to store structured data
- CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Validating user input
- Menu-driven programs
- Writing cleaner and more organized Python code

---

## ▶️ How to Run
```bash
python contact_book.py
