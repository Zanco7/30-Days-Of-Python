# Day 15 – BMI Calculator ⚖️

This project is part of my **30-Day Python Challenge**.

Today, I built a **BMI (Body Mass Index) Calculator** that calculates a user’s BMI based on their weight and height, then classifies it into standard categories.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Takes user weight (kg) and height (m)
- Calculates BMI using the standard formula
- Displays BMI value with two decimal precision
- Categorizes BMI (Underweight, Normal, Overweight, Obese)
- Allows repeated calculations
- Validates all user inputs

---

## 🧠 What I Learned
- Applying mathematical formulas in Python
- Input validation and error handling
- Using conditional statements for classification
- Formatting floating-point numbers
- Building clean user interaction loops

## ▶️ How to Run
```bash
python bmi_calculator.py
