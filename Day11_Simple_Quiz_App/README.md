# Day 11 – Simple Quiz App 🧠

This project is part of my **30-Day Python Challenge**.

Today, I built a **Simple Quiz App** that asks random Python-related questions, tracks the user’s score, and ends when all questions are answered or the user quits.

## 🚀 Features
- Randomly selects quiz questions
- Accepts user answers interactively
- Tracks and displays the score
- Prevents repeated questions
- Allows quitting anytime by typing `q`

## 🧠 What I Learned
- Working with lists of dictionaries
- Using `random.choice()` for randomness
- Removing items from a list dynamically
- Tracking progress and scores
- Building interactive console applications
