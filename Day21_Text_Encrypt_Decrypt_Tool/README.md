# Day 21 — Text Encrypt / Decrypt Tool

This project is part of my **30-Day Python Challenge**.

The Text Encrypt / Decrypt Tool allows users to encrypt or decrypt text using a simple Caesar Cipher technique. The program shifts alphabetic characters by a user-defined key while keeping non-alphabet characters unchanged.

## Features
- Encrypt text using a numeric key
- Decrypt encrypted text using the same key
- Supports both uppercase and lowercase letters
- Preserves spaces, numbers, and symbols
- Input validation for empty text and invalid keys

## How to Run
1. Make sure Python is installed
2. Navigate to the project folder
3. Run the script:

```bash
python encrypt_decrypt.py
