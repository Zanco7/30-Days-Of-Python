# 🎯 Day 2 — Number Guessing Game

This project is part of my **30-Day Python Challenge**.

A simple terminal-based number guessing game where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number within a limited number of attempts.

---

## 🧠 How the Game Works
- The program randomly selects a number between **1 and 20**
- The user has **3 attempts** to guess the correct number
- The game provides hints if the guess is **too high** or **too low**
- Input validation prevents invalid entries
- The user can choose to **play again** after losing

## 🛠 Concepts Practiced
- Random number generation
- User input handling
- Input validation with `try/except`
- Conditional logic
- Loops
- Game state reset
- Clean console output
