# Day 9 – Random Quote Generator 💬

This project is part of my **30-Day Python Challenge**.

Today, I built a **Random Quote Generator** that displays a motivational quote each time the program runs and allows the user to generate more quotes interactively.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Displays a random motivational quote
- User can generate another quote or exit
- Simple and clean terminal interaction
- Uses Python’s built-in `random` module

---

## 🧠 What I Learned
- Working with Python lists
- Using `random.choice()` to select items
- Creating loops for repeated user interaction
- Handling user input properly (`y/n`)
- Structuring clean, readable Python code

---

## ▶️ How to Run
```bash
python random_quote_generator.py
