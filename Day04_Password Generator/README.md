# 🔐 Day 4 — Password Generator

This project is part of my **30-Day Python Challenge**.

A simple command-line password generator that allows users to create strong, random passwords based on their preferences.

---

## 🧠 How the Program Works
- The user chooses the desired password length
- The user selects which character types to include:
  - Letters (uppercase & lowercase)
  - Numbers
  - Symbols
- The program generates a secure random password
- Input validation ensures correct choices
- The user can generate multiple passwords in one run
