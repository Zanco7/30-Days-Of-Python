# Day 13 – Currency Converter 💱

This project is part of my **30-Day Python Challenge**.

Today, I built a **Currency Converter** that converts amounts between different currencies using predefined exchange rates.

## 🚀 Features
- Supports multiple currencies (USD, EUR, GBP, KES, SOS)
- Converts between any supported currencies

- Prevents invalid or negative amounts
- Interactive loop to perform multiple conversions

## 🧠 What I Learned
- Working with dictionaries for data mapping
- Applying basic conversion formulas
- Handling user input validation
- Using loops for repeated operations
- Formatting numerical output

## ▶️ How to Run
```bash
python currency_converter.py
