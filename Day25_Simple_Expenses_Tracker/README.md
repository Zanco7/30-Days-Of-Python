# Day 25 — Simple Expenses Tracker

This project is a command-line **Simple Expenses Tracker** built with Python as part of my **30-Day Python Challenge**.

## Features
- Add expenses with amount, category, and description
- View all recorded expenses
- Calculate total expenses
- Input validation to prevent invalid data
- Menu-driven interface for easy navigation

## How It Works
1. The user selects an option from the menu.
2. Expenses are added with:
   - Amount (must be a valid number greater than 0)
   - Category
   - Description
3. Users can view all expenses in a numbered list.
4. The app calculates and displays the total expense amount.
5. The program runs continuously until the user exits.

## Concepts Used
- Functions
- Lists and tuples
- Loops (while, for)
- Conditional statements
- Error handling (try/except)
- User input validation

## How to Run
```bash
python simple_expenses_tracker.py
