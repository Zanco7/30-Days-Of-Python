# Day 30 — Python Challenge Completion Certificate 🎉

This final project marks the successful completion of my **30-Day Python Challenge**.

The program collects the user’s name and generates a **personalized congratulatory certificate** saved as a text file.

This project represents consistency, discipline, and growth over 30 days of Python learning.

## Features

- Validates empty input
- Generates a personalized congratulations message
- Saves the message to a text file (`congrats.txt`)
- Simple and meaningful project to close the challenge

## How It Works
1. The user enters their name.
2. The program validates the input.
3. A congratulatory message is generated.
4. The message is saved into a file called `congrats.txt`.
5. A success message confirms completion.
